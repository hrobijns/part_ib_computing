# Part IB: Computing
Scripts for the part IB computing source, followed during second year of Cambridge physics.

## Contents:

##### requirements.txt:
- text file containing required software to run files in this repository.

### Simple introductory scripts

##### BMI.py:
- script which lets the user calculate their BMI given metric or imperial inputs of height and weight.

##### perfect.py:
- script which lets the user calculate all perfect numbers upto a inputted limit.

##### ln2_monte_carlo.py:
- script that uses the monte carlo method to approximate ln(2)

##### newton_raphson_ln.py:
- script that uses the Newton-Raphson method to approximate ln(x) for any x.

### Simulations

##### planets.py:
- uses Newton's Law of Gravitation to simulate a planet orbiting a sun.
- used as a vanilla script to further explore the situation, e.g. unbound hyperbolic orbits.

##### collisions.py:
- uses conservation of momentum to simulate elastic collisions between 3 balls of similar mass and radius in a 2D box.
- used as a vanilla script to further explore the situation, changing masses and adding/removing balls etc.
